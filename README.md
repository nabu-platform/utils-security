utils-security
==============

Bundles a few security utilities together.
Bouncycastle is a very powerful library but sometimes a bit hard to use. 
Likewise the default security utilities in java are sometimes a bit opaque.
This library provides some default functionality around both. 
You can use it directly or use it as inspiration to see how it can be done.
