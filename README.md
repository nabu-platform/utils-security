# Description

This package bundles a few security utilities together. Bouncycastle is a very powerful library but sometimes a bit hard to use.
Especially since the rewrite it is sometimes hard to find how-to's for certain things.
Likewise the default security utilities in java are sometimes a bit opaque.

This library provides some default functionality around both. 
Some methods may seem trivial but they are usually there to describe how something is done.
